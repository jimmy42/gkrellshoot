comments : I wrote this so that I can have quick access to screen lock
	   as well as screen shoot. Hope it will be useful for you.

	   Added animation to this plugin using 
	   Tom Gilbert's ( http://linuxbrit.co.uk/ ) routines. Right now
	   I have about 11 animations of which I like 'Mesh' and
	   'Rotating Star'
